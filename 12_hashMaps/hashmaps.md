# HashMaps


### What is it?

- Also known as an Associative Array, a HashMap is a data structure that allows for us to store a key which represents a value or a series of values for easy look up. Aside from coding, we have a dictionary that contains many words and to go one by one is time consuming. Therefore, generally, we start with the first letter of the word and go through a smaller section of the dictionary. The idea is that the key will allow for the same thing and easy access to the value we are searching for.

#### Hashing

- Now HashMaps most notably take advantage of Hashing.
- Hashing is the process of taking text and or a string and converting it into a number. Being the number is shorter, it allows for faster look up time. 
- Now it may seem weird at first to convert a character into a number but remember that each character has a numerical representation generally known as an ASCII value. Essentially, each character on your keyboard has a a representation in ASCII notation.
- For the curious mind, here is a link: http://ascii.cl/
- Now what the Hash() method does is convert the string into a number using a variety of different ways (one of which could involve the ASCII values) and then uses that number to store the value you have asked for in its corresponding place.
