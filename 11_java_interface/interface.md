# Java Interface


### What is it?

- an Interface is a way for a set of methods to be shared by multiple objects.
- A simple example would be an RPG game or any game for that matter. You would like an interface that explains a lof of the interactions that a character good or bad can do, like do damage, receive damage, say something when they get hit, etc.
- Benefits:
	- It allows us to organize our coding to allow for many methods to be descibed and then per each object be modified accordingly.
	- Many developers can share an interface but build their own objects, allowing for each object written seperately to contain their own approaches to certain methods.

### Lets make a simple RPG Game!

- As mentioned above in my simple example, an RPG game will be useful to see how interface works as well as the benefits. 

- To begin, we need to create an interface and be sure to include the package all your objects and interfaces reside in on the top of each file.
