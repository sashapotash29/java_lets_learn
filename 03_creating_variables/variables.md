How to create Variables!


Variable holds a piece of data

This lesson will focus on data types:
	- String
	- Char
	- Integer

STRINGS

	- Always put the value inside of double quotations.
	- String is written as such:
		- " String word = "Hello I am a string"; "
		- Notice that decleration of Word as a string is necessary 
			unlike python where the interpreter will guess the data type.

CHAR - "a single unicode character"

	- Put the value inside of double quotations.
	- Example:
		- " char character ='C'; "
		- Notice that the CHAR is in single quotes and the class "char" is lower case.

INTEGER - "a number WITHOUT decimal points (i.e. not a Float/Real)"

	- Any number between -2.14 billion to +2.14 billion.
	- Example:
		- " int number = 29;  "

NOTE:
	- Putting a string and integer together is as simple as string concatenation.
	- Example: 
		- " System.out.println("I am a string, but I'm adding a integer called " + number); "
		- number is the same value as defined above.
